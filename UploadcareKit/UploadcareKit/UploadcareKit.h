 Upload your data from specified NSData [images, video, etc.].
 
 Sets the properties with a blocks that executes either the specified success, failure or upload progress block, depending on the state of the request on completion. If error returns a value, which can be caused by an unacceptable status code or content type, then failure is executed. Otherwise, success is executed.
 
 @param filename Sets the filename for uploaded data that can be used on object description
 @param data NSData object with content of your data that you trying to upload
 @param uploadProgressBlock Sets a callback to be called when an undetermined number of bytes have been uploaded to the server. A block object to be called when an undetermined number of bytes have been uploaded to the server. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the number of bytes written since the last time the upload progress block was called, the total bytes written, and the total bytes expected to be written during the request, as initially determined by the length of the HTTP body. This block may be called multiple times.
 @param success The block to be executed on the completion of a successful request. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the UploadcareFile object created from the response data of request.
 @param failure A block object to be executed when the operation finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully, but encountered an error while parsing the resonse data as JSON. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the error describing the network or parsing error that occurred.
